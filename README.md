Overview of the Project
PROJECT 1:Developing a simple calculator using python program
Objective:Understanding Basic Programming Concepts: Writing a calculator program helps you grasp fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control structures.

Learning Python Syntax: It provides a practical way to learn and practice Python syntax, including functions, loops, and conditionals.

Problem-Solving Skills: It enhances your problem-solving skills by breaking down a larger problem (creating a calculator) into smaller, manageable tasks.

User Input and Output: You learn how to handle user input and display output, which are essential skills for any interactive program.

Error Handling: Implementing error handling to manage invalid inputs or operations (like division by zero) helps you understand how to make your programs more robust.

Modular Programming: By dividing the calculator's functionality into different functions or modules, you practice writing clean, modular code.

Algorithm Design: You get to design algorithms for basic arithmetic operations and possibly more complex functions if you extend the calculator's capabilities.

Practical Application: It provides a practical application of your coding skills, resulting in a useful tool that you can actually use.

Foundation for Advanced Projects: Building a simple calculator can serve as a foundation for more advanced projects, such as scientific calculators or graphical user interface (GUI) applications.

Confidence Boost: Successfully completing a project like this can boost your confidence and motivate you to tackle more complex programming challenges.
